# Adequate Rules for Software Development

a.k.a Things I think I know about how to do development, but retain the rights to change later based on more input.

### Modular Systems
Systems that are comprised of smaller pieces that can be inspected, debugged, upgraded. and reasoned about independently.

### Simplicity

#### Data

1. Software is data manipulation
1. Homoiconicity - code as data


### Late Binding
Dependency Injection is an eager binding language's answer.  Just pick a language where this is more natural.
